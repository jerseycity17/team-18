Build a set of secure, digital, multi-channel pathways for Family Promise case managers to easily reach out to families to provide information, assistance, referrals, share opportunities, or to direct them to other resources, including financial capability, tenancy, job training and more.

Families would be open to accessing this connection in multiple ways from different devices or locations, knowing itâ€™s secure, safe and easy to use.  In addition graduates can interact dynamically with applications or tools to improve a variety of core skills.

Importantly, the tool(s) would evolve, helping to maximize the number of graduates that remain in contact with Affiliates beyond one or two years.

Below are some of the key features we will be incorporating:

1. Ability for families to securely communicate with Case Managers and/or Share Documents
2. Ability for Case managers to provide information/referrals/opportunities to families
3. Accessibility via multiple methods (Web, Mobile App, Voice, SMS)
4. Simple and intuitive interfaces that are easy to navigate for non-technical users
5. Dashboard for case managers to track and report metrics, such as engagements and life status
